# Remap-Memory-Region
Basic example of how to change the initial rights on a memory region during runtime.
I need to clean this up.

If you are using this and want to avoid detection, remap whatever process it is back to it's initial changes after write. You'll need to rejig the code, but this is more of an example with platform invokes than anything.
